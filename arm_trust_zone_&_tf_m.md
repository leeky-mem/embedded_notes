# ARM Trust Zone

# TF-M
Trusted Firmware-M (TF-M) implements the Secure Processing Environment (SPE) for Armv8-M, Armv8.1-M architectures (e.g. the Cortex-M33, Cortex-M23, Cortex-M55, Cortex-M85 processors) and dual-core platforms.
It is the platform security architecture reference implementation aligning with PSA Certified guidelines, enabling chips, Real Time Operating Systems and devices to become PSA Certified.

TF-M relies on an isolation boundary between the Non-secure Processing Environment (NSPE) and the Secure Processing Environment (SPE). 
It can but is not limited to using the Arm TrustZone technology on Armv8-M and Armv8.1-M architectures. 
In pre-Armv8-M architectures physical core isolation is required.
TF-M consists of:
- Secure Boot to authenticate NSPE and SPE images
- TF-M Core for controlling the isolation, communication and execution within SPE and with NSPE
-Crypto, Internal Trusted Storage (ITS), Protected Storage (PS), Firmware Update and Attestation secure services
